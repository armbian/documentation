# Datacenter access

Armbian runs a hardware lab — *the Datacenter* — a rack of real boards on real
networks that our CI flashes, powers, boots, tests and measures automatically.
Board maintainers can reach these boards remotely to debug problems, reproduce
issues and validate images on actual hardware.

Access is over a VPN and is available to members of the
[**board-maintainers**](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/teams/board-maintainers)
GitHub team. Everything below (VPN login and board access) only works once you
are on that team.

## Requesting access

The `board-maintainers` team is a *visible* team, so organization members can
request to join it themselves:

- **If you are already an Armbian GitHub organization member** — open the
  [board-maintainers team page](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/teams/board-maintainers)
  and click **Request to join**. A team maintainer reviews and approves it.
- **If you are not an organization member yet** — every contributor is
  automatically invited to become a member of the
  [Armbian organization](https://github.com/armbian), so contribute (e.g. a
  merged pull request) and accept the invitation that follows. Once you are an
  org member, request to join the team as above.

## Connect via VPN (Netbird)

The Datacenter network is reached through [Netbird](https://netbird.io), a
WireGuard-based mesh VPN. Authentication is via **GitHub**: you sign in with your
GitHub account and are let in if you belong to the `board-maintainers` team.

### 1. Install the Netbird client

On Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
```

On macOS and Windows, install the client from
[netbird.io/downloads](https://netbird.io/downloads) (or via `brew`, `winget`,
etc.).

### 2. Connect to Armbian's Netbird

```bash
netbird up --management-url https://netbird.armbian.com
```

This opens your browser to authenticate:

1. On the Netbird sign-in screen, choose **Continue with Authentik**.

    ![Netbird sign-in — Continue with Authentik](../images/authentic-2.png){ width=50% }

2. On the *Armbian Auth* screen, click the **GitHub** icon (the button below
    *Log in* — not the email/username field) and authorize the request.

    ![Armbian Auth — sign in with GitHub](../images/authentic-1.png){ width=50% }

Once GitHub confirms you are a `board-maintainers` member you are connected to
the Datacenter mesh. The management URL is remembered, so next time you can just
run `netbird up`.

Check the connection and your assigned VPN address:

```bash
netbird status
```

To disconnect, run `netbird down`.

## Access boards

Once connected you are on the Datacenter network and can reach the boards
directly by their IP address.

Find the board you need — its model and IP address — in the [Boards](#boards)
list below, then SSH in as **root**:

```bash
ssh root@<board-ip>        # e.g. ssh root@10.0.50.42
```

No password is needed — every board installs the SSH public keys from your
GitHub account (`https://github.com/<your-username>.keys`) into root's
authorized keys, so make sure the matching private key is on the machine you
connect from.

If a board is unreachable it may be powered off or mid-test. For anything you
cannot resolve (missing access, a wedged board), reach out on the
[Armbian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/armbian) channels.

!!! warning "Reflashing is under testing"
    Automated board reflashing is still experimental. If you reflash a board and
    accidentally brick it or leave it unresponsive, please report it on the
    [Armbian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/armbian) so it can be recovered.

## Boards

The datacenter's board inventory — which boards are operational or broken — now lives on the [**Datacenter boards**](/status/boards/) status page.
