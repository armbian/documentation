# Frequently asked questions

- **This information is mainly for new/inexperienced users but could be useful for others too.**

## Why I cannot simply shove a random image into my board to work like on my PC?

Shortly explain difference between ARM and Intel architecure. Bus system, device tree....that reasons.
	
## Why is Armbian constantly asking for money? Free software should be free.

Keeping this service up costs maintainers between 30 and 60 hours every day. We have to invest around 3000 EUR into this service every day just to keep it up. Without developing any serious feature which development can easily cost exactly the same. This software you are using for free, you don't need to buy licence, you don't need to pay for best effort support. Which is yet another waste of our precious time. 

We have to maintain our infrastructure, where biggest costs is our time, then electricity, then hardware itself. Sometimes we get free hardware, but very rare it comes with electricity costs paid and with a people that would maintain this for us. All this is needed, you click and download very fast whereever you are. 

There is more and more positions, where it is nearly impossible to get a reliable voolonteer, but resource is critical for project development. It is needed to keep up and to secure service you are wishing.

Each question that is directed toward our team is generating us costs. We waste time and energy, which we don't want. Especially because questions are repeating and users comodity is preventing them to invest 5 seconds into the search.
 
Those costs go sky high when someone expets personal dedication - answering in hard technical questions can easily cost us additional 10 hours per day of totally wasted time. Private technical communition on public project is most wasted time since its most ineffective way to share knowledge. Which we would like to share as much as possible, but all have to work elsewhere to cover for our family and to cover for your pleasere you have with this project. We can only afford to cover provide forums, docs, IRC/discord.

## Why does Armbian not support RaspberryPi?

...

## What does WIP/EOS/CSC mean?

- WIP: Work in progress
  - Basic functions can be tested but not ready for production yet
- CSC: Community supported configuration
  - Community contributed support. No official support from Armbian development team
- EOS: End of life
  - Support ended

## I have no technical knowledge. How can I help?

We need many different profiles of people to run this project and just about any help, help on development. Since in other case developers have to fix web pages, developers have to run projects, developers have to seek for money, developers have to maintain servers, developers have to maintain forum, developers have to moderate forums, developers have to maintain infrastructure, developers have to maintain relations with partners, developers have to waste time on repeated support question, developers have to deal with "customers", ...

## Why are old-stable distributions like Ubuntu Bionic or Debian Stretch not supported?

The Armbian project has very limited human and financial ressources so it can focus on just a few up-to-date operating systems only.

## Why does Armbian not support TV boxes? The market is huge!

Single board computer vendors are making their computers on as cheap as possible principle. To be honest, there are some exceptions, which in fact produce better quality then the others. In general they provide more or less accurate schematics and they have some engineers that are available for general public and you can ask them things here and there. Most of them try to keep up with the highest standards of hardware development. With proper documentation and minimal support, costs of software development are significantly lower. This is especially important, because we waste our precious private time to secure proper hw functioniong trought the time.

TV boxes lakcs of any docuentation, there are frequent changes of components without any notice, boot mechanism is closed source and almost all Armbian builds that exist in the wild are community hacks. Market is huge, but since public doesn't have interest to cover costs of support, which are here only much bigger, our involvement to provide support is simply insane and stupid. It only eats our personal time and finances.
