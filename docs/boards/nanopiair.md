- Wireless: Air has no aerial so you need to attach an antenna to the u.FL connector!
- known issues with legacy images / testing needed: audio out in all variants
- serial console gadget on the OTG port is available after the system boots up. Please make sure that board is properly powered (i.e. with microUSB Y cable or via GPIO pins) because a standard PC USB port will not provide enough current to the board
