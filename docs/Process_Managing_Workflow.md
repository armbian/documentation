Jira where development work is entered and prioritized.

# Issue Types

When creating issues, try to assign issue type most approprate.   Issue type _can_ be changed later so don't worry too much.  If possible assign to a "Fix Version" aka Release.

* Bug -- Work to solve a bug
* Task -- Work that is clearly defined
* Story -- Large scope of work. Can be for work with subtasks, or vague work such as "A User should be able to XYZ"

# Work Queue

The easiest way to follow the work queue [Upcoming Release Kanban Board](https://armbian.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=2&projectKey=AR&atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2JlNTliN2ZkNTJiNDYzNGI4YzEzOGE4YjhmOWU3MDQiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).  This Board lists only work select for the upcoming release.

Work state are listed in 3 columns, and sorted by priority.

Columns:
* Todo
    * Work prioritized to be done next
    * Pick up any task from this column
* In Progress
    * Work In Progress
* Done
    * Shows **recently** completed work.  Has time limit to keep board clean

# Managing Work

All issues for an upcoming release are assigned a "Fix Version" to indicate release number.

## Backlog

With the Kanban Board, there are 2 states for the Upcoming Release backlog.

* Todo - These tasks are visible the todo column of the Kanban board. To keep things simple, there shouldnt be more than 5-10 issues in Todo
* Backlog -- Other tasks seleceted for release, but not are not visible on the Kanban board.  The purposee of this is to keep the Todo column clean and easy to work from.  As the Todo column clears, prioritize next tasks in backlog by moving them to todo.
