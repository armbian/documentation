# Deploy Advanced Services and Applications with Ease

The **Armbian Software** section, integrated into the `armbian-config` tool, offers a streamlined way to install a curated selection of optimized, ready-to-use software for your device — all in just a few clicks.

Designed with efficiency in mind, it **automates the entire installation and configuration process**, saving time and eliminating complexity for both beginners and advanced users.

Most applications are delivered as **preconfigured Docker containers**, specifically adjusted for deployment on Armbian OS. This ensures consistent behavior, simplified management, and seamless integration with your system. Native (non-Docker) installations are also supported where appropriate.

Armbian Software applies **board-specific performance tweaks and hardware optimizations**, ensuring your system runs smoothly, reliably, and with peak efficiency.

To strengthen **security and network hygiene**, all installed services are **isolated on a dedicated network bridge**, reducing exposure and ensuring clean separation between system components and public interfaces.

Managing your software is equally efficient: Armbian Software supports **clean uninstallation**, **manual upgrades**, and **optional automatic updates** — for both Docker-based and native applications. You stay in control of your system while benefiting from secure and up-to-date software.

To maintain reliability and quality, **application installations are automatically tested on a daily basis**, ensuring consistent performance and catching issues early across supported platforms.

## Wide Hardware Compatibility

Armbian Software offers **full support for x86 and ARM64 (aarch64)** architectures. **Partial support** is also available for **ARMHF (armv7)** and **RISCV64**, enabling deployment on a broad range of single-board computers and edge devices.

Whether you're building a lightweight server, a desktop environment, or a specialized appliance, Armbian Software provides **lean, compatible, and well-tested packages** tailored for Armbian-supported systems.
