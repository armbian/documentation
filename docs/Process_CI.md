# Build pipelines

<br>

Armbian Build pipelines are combination of Github Actions and scripts that run on our servers.  Armbian is providing a large quantity of compiled binaries and images which builds are distributed over our self-hosted build farm.

You can recreate image(s) from sources - set `packages from repository` to *no* - or from packages that are already in repository (default). In case you choose to build from sources, stable https://apt.armbian.com repository is going to be populated with newly created u-boot, kernel and **BSP packages for all boards** under (patched) stable version (yy.mm.**x+1**) which is incremented automatically if process succeeds.

When new artifacts are created for stable builds, content is uploaded to CDN, then download and repository indexes are updated.  The process is typically complete in 1 to 2 days for major releases.
