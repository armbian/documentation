## Prepare build lists


### Recommended images

Recommended images on download pages and in [Armbian imager](http://imager.armbian.com/) are automatically generated via regular expression mapping file [`exposed.map`](https://github.armbian.com/release-targets/exposed.map). This file is generated by the `generate_targets.py` script from [`image-info.json`](https://github.armbian.com/image-info.json).

Example:

```
bananapim7/archive/Armbian_[0-9].*Bananapim7_noble_vendor_[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*_gnome-kisak_desktop.img.xz
bananapim7/archive/Armbian_[0-9].*Bananapim7_bookworm_vendor_[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*_minimal.img.xz
```

Maximum 2 images per board: **bookworm minimal** for all boards, plus a second image based on hardware classification (see table below). LoongArch boards only get one image (bookworm minimal only).

### Target generation

Build target YAML files are automatically generated from [`image-info.json`](https://github.armbian.com/image-info.json), which is produced by the build framework's command: `./compile.sh inventory-boards`.

Generated files:

- [`targets-release-apps.yaml`](https://github.armbian.com/release-targets/targets-release-apps.yaml) - One image per board with app-specific extensions
- [`targets-release-standard-support.yaml`](https://github.armbian.com/release-targets/targets-release-standard-support.yaml) - Full stable/release builds
- [`targets-release-nightly.yaml`](https://github.armbian.com/release-targets/targets-release-nightly.yaml) - Nightly builds with hardware-based desktop selection
- [`targets-release-community-maintained.yaml`](https://github.armbian.com/release-targets/targets-release-community-maintained.yaml) - Community/CSC/TVB board builds

???+ Note
    For changes to target generation logic, submit PR to the Python script at [armbian.github.io](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/scripts/generate_targets.py)

### Hardware-based board classification

Boards are automatically classified by hardware speed and architecture to determine appropriate desktop environments:

|**Category** | **Condition** | **Desktop (nightly/community)**|
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Fast HDMI** | ARM64/x86 with video, not in slow list | GNOME |
| **Slow HDMI** | ARM 32-bit or specific slower SoCs | XFCE |
| **Headless** | Boards without video output | CLI only |
| **RISC-V** | ARCH = riscv64 | CLI only |
| **LoongArch** | ARCH = loongarch64 | CLI only (sid only) |

**Slow hardware list** (gets XFCE):

- ARM 32-bit (arm/armhf) architecture
- Allwinner H3/H5/H6 (sun50iw*, sun55iw*)
- Amlogic S905X/S912/S905X2/S922X/A311D (meson-gxbb, meson-gxl, meson-g12a, meson-g12b, meson-sm1)
- Nuvoton MA35D1
- Rockchip RK3328/RK3399/RK3399PRO

All other ARM64 and x86 boards with video are classified as **fast** (gets GNOME).

### Automatic extensions

Fast HDMI boards automatically receive these extensions:

- `v4l2loopback-dkms` - Video4Linux loopback device support
- `mesa-vpu` - VPU driver for video acceleration

These can be supplemented with manual extensions via the extensions map.

### Manual overrides

**Blacklisting** - exclude boards from automatic generation:

Files: [`targets-release-nightly.blacklist`](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-nightly.blacklist), [`targets-release-community-maintained.blacklist`](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-community-maintained.blacklist)

**Manual targets** - add custom build targets:

Files: [`targets-release-nightly.manual`](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-nightly.manual), [`targets-release-community-maintained.manual`](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-community-maintained.manual)

**Extensions** - add board-specific extensions:

File: [`targets-extensions.map`](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-extensions.map)

Format:
```
BOARD_NAME:branch1:branch2:...:ENABLE_EXTENSIONS="ext1,ext2"
```

Example:
```
khadas-edge2:legacy:vendor:,ENABLE_EXTENSIONS="image-output-oowow,v4l2loopback-dkms,mesa-vpu"
```

Wildcards apply to all branches:
```
BOARD_NAME::ENABLE_EXTENSIONS="ext1,ext2"
```

???+ Note
    Manual extensions are **merged** with automatic extensions, not replaced.

### Kernel Descriptions for Download Pages

Each kernel branch can include an optional description, automatically generated by the [generate-build-lists workflow](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-build-lists.yaml) and published to [`kernel-description.json`](https://github.armbian.com/data/release-targets/kernel-description.json).

Descriptions are generated from `image-info.json` using template-based categorization (current/edge/legacy/vendor/custom) with version-appropriate naming and platform-specific optimization details.

### Testing

Unfortunatelly this part does not have testing at PR stage.

## Prepare Standard Support images for release

???+ Info
    Manual executing permissions are tied to [release manager role](/Process_Contribute/#release-manager).

[![Build Standard Support Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.yml)

This build workflow is executed manually when making:

- a set of images for specific device
- a set of images for specific maintainer
- a full set of stable release images (default)

**Notes**:

- this process prepares images for release without pushing them to the download pages
- you can only generate images that are defined in [targets-release-standard-support.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-standard-support.yaml) build lists!
- images generation workflows are compiled and are pretty much the same, just with different defaults

### 1. Open [workflow](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.yml) and click

![Run Workflow](images/run-workflow.png)

### 2. Select board

![Workflow](images/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.png)

**Bump version**: Select if you want to trigger system wide version bump.
**Version override**: Set version under which you want to release images.

Images versions are stored in JSON files:

- https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/stable.json
- https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/nightly.json

### 3. Run workflow

![Build](images/run-worflow-button.png)

**(Workflow takes around 15 minutes to complete. In case of network issues it can also take hours)**

Generated images are uploaded to incoming folder [https://fi.mirror.armbian.de/incoming/](https://fi.mirror.armbian.de/incoming/) under **your GitHub username** and once they are confirmed working, please notify [@igorpecovnik](https://github.com/igorpecovnik) to move them to official download pages. Once images are moved to [main download section](https://www.armbian.com/download/), automation refreshes download pages index within 15-30 minutes.

### Aditional options

Generates stable images defined in [targets-release-standard-support.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-standard-support.yaml).

We are generating several images for each download / hardware target. They are automatically sorted by sections:

- Desktop releases
- Server and IOT releases
- Dedicated applications

Images generation can be customized:

- Framework build branch
  - main (make images from trunk)
  - vXX.X (previous stable release)
- Bump Version (system wide version bump)
- Version override (in case you don't want to use latest)
- Board (make images for one board only)
- Maintainer (make images for selected maintainer)

## Prepare application images for release (release manager)

[![Build Dedicated Application Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-apps.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-apps.yml)

This build workflow is executed manually when making:

- a set of application images for specific device
- a set of application images for specific maintainer
- a full set of application images (default)

**Notes**:

- **application images are released 10-15 minutes after build finishes succesfully**
- you can only generate images for applications that are defined in [targets-release-apps.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-apps.yaml) build lists!
- images generation workflows are compiled and are pretty much the same, just with different defaults

### 1. Open [workflow](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-apps.yml) and click

![Run Workflow](images/run-workflow.png)

### 2. Select board

![Workflow](images/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.png)

**Version override**: Use this feature if you want to keep them under the same version, but not lower then [last released](https://docs.armbian.com/Release_Changelog/#changelog).

### 3. Run workflow

![Build](images/run-worflow-button.png)

**(Workflow takes around 15 minutes to complete. In case of network issues it can also take hours)**

Generated images are hosted at GitHub [https://github.com/armbian/distribution/releases](https://github.com/armbian/distribution/releases) and released at once. Automation refreshes download pages within 15-30 minutes after/if workflow finished succesfully.

![Dedicated Application Images](images/dedicated-applications.png)

### Aditional options

Generates dedicated application images defined in [targets-release-apps.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-apps.yaml). This file is automatically generated from `image-info.json` by the [generate-targets workflow](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-targets.yaml).

Images generation can be customized:

- framework build branch
  - main (make images from trunk)
  - vXX.X (previous stable release)
- Bump Version (system wide version bump)
- Version override (in case you don't want to use latest)
- board (make images only for one board)
- maintainer (make images for selected maintainer)

## Repository update (cronjob/release manager)

This pulls packages from build framework OCI cache located at GitHub and from [various 3rd party repositories](https://github.com/armbian/os/wiki/Import-3rd-party-packages) such as Chrome, Chromium, Code, Discord, (latest) ZFS, Thunderbird, Zoom, ... and pushes them to:

- `apt.armbian.com` (only new packages are added)
- `beta.armbian.com` (whole repository is recreated from scratch)

### 1. Open [workflow](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/repository-update.yml) and click

![Run Workflow](images/run-workflow.png)

Action is executed automatically when artifact generations completes. Or manually.

### 2. Include [artifacts from generated image(s)](https://netcup.armbian.com/partial/)

When
- [ ] Add https://netcup.armbian.com/partial/ to stable repo

is selected.

### 3. Run workflow

**(Workflow takes around 60 minutes to complete)**

## Build all artifacts (cronjob)

[![Build All Artifacts](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-all.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-all.yml)

Generates all build artifacts cache for targets defined in [targets-all-not-eos.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/userpatches/targets-all-not-eos.yaml). This build job runs **every 8 hours** and can also be run manually when needed.

This build job **needs to be successfully completed** in order to proceed generating any OS images!

## Build Rolling Release Images (cronjob)

[![Build Nightly Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-nightly.yml)

Generates all nightly (Rolling Release) images defined in [targets-release-nightly.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/release-targets/targets-release-nightly.yaml). This file is automatically generated from `image-info.json` by the [generate-targets workflow](https://github.com/armbian/armbian.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-targets.yaml).

This build job runs every day at 9 a.m. UTC and can also be run manually when needed. Download pages are refreshed [automatically](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/webindex-update.yml) after successful build.

![Build](images/rolling-releases.png)

## Full distro test builds (cronjob/release manager)

[![Build Nightly Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/full-distro-build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/full-distro-build-and-test.yml)

Generates all supported build combinations (minimal, cli, desktops) for x86 architecture to check package level changes inconsistency and dependencies.

Options:

- Framework build branch
  - **main**
  - testing_branch (string)

## Build all artifacts (admin/PR)

Generates artifacts at Pull Requests code. Build starts when label of Pull Request is set to "Build". Requires administration privileges.
