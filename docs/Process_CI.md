## Build All Artifacts (cronjob)

[![Build All Artifacts](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-all.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-all.yml)

Generates all build artifacts cache for targets defined in [targets-all-not-eos.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/userpatches/targets-all-not-eos.yaml). This build job runs **every 8 hours** and can also be run manually when needed. This build job needs to be successfully completed in order to proceed generating OS images.

## Build Rolling Release Images (cronjob)

[![Build Nightly Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-nightly.yml)

Generates all nighly (Rolling Release) images defined in [targets-release-nightly.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/userpatches/targets-release-nightly.yaml). This build job runs every day at **9 am UTC** and can also be run manually when needed. Download pages are refreshed [automatically](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/webindex-update.yml) if build succeeds.

## Build Standard Support Images (admin)

[![Build Standard Support Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/complete-artifact-matrix-standard-support.yml)

Generates stable images defined in [targets-release-standard-support.yaml](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/userpatches/targets-release-standard-support.yaml). This file is autogenerated from [targets-release-standard-support.template](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/userpatches/targets-release-standard-support.template).

This build run is executed manually when making:
- a full set of stable release images
- a set of images for specific device
- a set of images for specific maintainer

Images generation can be customized:

- Framework build branch
  - main
  - v24.5 (previous stable release)
- Version override (leave empty for automatic bump)
  - main
  - v24.5 (previous stable release)
- Board (make images only for one board)
- Maintainer (make images for selected maintainer)

Generated images are uploaded to incoming folder: https://netcup.armbian.com/incoming/ and once they are confirmed working, please notify @igor to move them to official download pages. Once images are moved to main download section, automation refresh download pages within 15-30 minutes.

## Repository update (admin)

This pulls packages from build framework OCI cache located at GitHub and from [various 3rd party repositories](https://github.com/armbian/os/wiki/Import-3rd-party-packages) such as Chrome, Chromium, Code, Discord, (latest) ZFS, Thunderbird, Zoom, ... and pushes them to:

- `apt.armbian.com` = new packages are added
- `beta.armbian.com` = whole repository is recreated from scratch.

Action is executed automatically when artifact generations completes. Or manually.

When
- [ ] Add https://netcup.armbian.com/partial/ to stable repo

is selected, it will include packages that were build during images recreation. It will add everything that is inside this folder https://netcup.armbian.com/partial/

## Watchdog (cronjob)

Runs every 15 minutes and re-trigger [failed builds](https://github.com/armbian/os/blob/main/.github/workflows/watchdog.yml#L26) six (6) times before finally gives out. This addresses various instabilities when building many artifacts on different hardware: 

- network timeouts
- artifact download failure
- loop devices allocation failure
- runner running low on space

## Smoke tests on hardware devices

Smoke testing is preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release. Our test case is constructed of three steps:

![Smoke](images/smoke-tests.png)

- powering test equipment, consistent from several network switches, power supplies and dozens of hardware platforms
- running upgrade, reboot, repository switch, reboot, ... tests in parallel
- uploading a test report as build artefact following by powering the devices off.

## Automatic Pull Requests Labeler

[![Automatic Labeler](https://github.com/armbian/build/actions/workflows/labeler.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/build/actions/workflows/labeler.yml)

Automatically label new pull request based on the paths of files which are being changed. Configuration file can be found in:

        .github/labeler.yml

## Full distro test builds

[![Build Nightly Images](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/full-distro-build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/armbian/os/actions/workflows/full-distro-build-and-test.yml)

Generates all supported build combinations (minimal, cli, desktops) for x86 arhitecture.

Options:

- Framework build branch
  - **main**
  - testing_branch (string)

## Automatic Kernel Build at Pull Requests

Generates kernels at Pull Requests if their code, patches or config was changed. Build starts when label of Pull Request is set to "Ready to review"

## Lint On Scripts

![Lint](images/linterror.png)

Run [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) on changed shell scripts and report problems within. Since our scripts are full of shellcheck problems we don't block merging on those errors. Not yet.

Linting is run automatically on pull requests change.

## Scorecards Security Scan

Scorecards is an automated tool that assesses a number of important heuristics ("checks") associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10. You can use these scores to understand specific areas to improve in order to strengthen the security posture of your project. You can also assess the risks that dependencies introduce, and make informed decisions about accepting these risks, evaluating alternative solutions, or working with the maintainers to make improvements.

## Kernel hardening analysis

This analysis checks kernel config if changed.

There are plenty of security hardening options for the Linux kernel. A lot of them are not enabled by the major distros. We have to enable these options ourselves to make our systems more secure.
