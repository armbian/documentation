#### Alternative kernels


Use alternative kernels

<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/KER001-header.md --->
Switching between different kernel versions can significantly impact the functionality of your device. A newer or older kernel may introduce changes to hardware compatibility, drivers, and system stability. Some features may stop working, while others may improve or be reintroduced.

!!! danger "Kernel changes carry inherent risks!"

    - A mismatched or incompatible kernel may result in **boot failures**, rendering the system unresponsive.
    - Certain peripherals or hardware components (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPU acceleration, or power management) may no longer function correctly.
    - Custom configurations or third-party modules might need to be recompiled or adjusted to work with the new kernel.

    Precautions Before Switching Kernels
    Before switching kernels, it is **strongly recommended** to:

    1. **Back up your system** to prevent data loss.
    2. **Verify compatibility** of your hardware and essential drivers with the target kernel version.
    3. **Keep a rescue method available**, such as a bootable SD card / USB drive or serial console access, to recover the system if necessary.

    Recovery Steps if Boot Fails
    If your device fails to boot after a kernel change, you may need to:

    - **Revert to a previous working kernel** using recovery options.
    - **Use a serial console or debug mode** to diagnose the issue.
    - **Reinstall the system** if no recovery options are available.

    **Exercise caution when switching kernels, especially on production systems or devices with limited recovery options.**

#### Kernel Headers


Install Linux headers


<!--- section image START from tools/include/images/HEAD01.png --->
[![Kernel Headers](/images/HEAD01.png)](#)
<!--- section image STOP from tools/include/images/HEAD01.png --->


<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/HEAD01-header.md --->
Kernel headers are files required to build modules (drivers) or software that interfaces directly with the Linux kernel. Installing headers ensures compatibility when compiling custom drivers, DKMS modules (like ZFS, WireGuard), or updating third-party software that requires access to kernel internals. The installed headers match your running kernel version and are critical for system extensions and hardware support.

<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/DTO001-header.md --->
Device Tree Overlays allow you to dynamically modify the Linux device tree at runtime, without rebuilding the kernel. They are used to enable or configure specific hardware features (like GPIO pins, IÂ²C, SPI, sensors, displays) on single-board computers. Overlays are small snippets that can add, change, or remove parts of the hardware description, making it flexible to adapt the system for different peripherals without recompiling the full device tree.

<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/BOOT01-header.md --->
Edit the boot environment allows you to modify critical boot settings stored in `/boot/armbianEnv.txt`. You can adjust options such as root filesystem location, kernel parameters, overlays, boot targets, or enable advanced features like early serial console. This is essential for fine-tuning hardware support, troubleshooting, or optimizing system startup behavior.

## Storage

#### Install


<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/STO001-header.md --->
This section provides an option to transfer the live running Armbian system from an SD card to internal storage devices such as eMMC, SATA, NVMe, or USB drives. It prepares the target storage, copies the active system, adjusts bootloader settings, and ensures the system can boot independently without requiring reinstallation.

#### Read Only FS


Enable read only filesystem


<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/ROO001-header.md --->
Read-only filesystem is enabled using overlayroot, a utility that places a temporary writable layer over the system root filesystem. Changes made during runtime are redirected into RAM or an alternative writable storage, while the underlying system remains untouched. This ensures that after a reboot, the system returns to a clean original state. It's ideal for kiosks, appliances, SD card-based systems, and scenarios where long-term filesystem durability and recovery are critical.

<!--- header START from tools/include/markdown/ZFS001-header.md --->
ZFS is an advanced, high-performance file system and volume manager designed for data integrity, scalability, and ease of use. It offers features like copy-on-write snapshots, native compression, data deduplication, automatic repair, and efficient storage pooling. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems, ZFS is ideal for handling large amounts of data reliably with minimal maintenance.

When enabling ZFS support, Armbian checks if the running kernel can support ZFS, installs matching kernel headers if necessary, and builds the ZFS DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) module automatically.

##### Key Features

###### Data Integrity
- **Copy-on-Write (CoW):** Prevents data corruption by never overwriting live data.
- **Checksumming:** Detects and corrects silent data corruption (bit rot).

###### Storage Management
- **Pooled Storage:** Eliminates the need for traditional partitions; all storage is managed dynamically.
- **Snapshots & Clones:** Creates instant backups without using extra storage.

###### Performance & Scalability
- **Efficient Compression & Deduplication:** Reduces storage usage without performance loss.
- **Dynamic Striping & Caching:** Distributes data across multiple disks for optimized read/write speeds.

###### Advanced Security
- **Native Encryption:** Supports dataset-level encryption for secure data storage.
- **RAID-Z:** A superior RAID alternative that prevents write-hole issues.

Sandboxed & containerised SSH server allows ssh access without giving keys to the entire server. Giving ssh access via private key often means giving full access to the server. This container creates a limited and sandboxed environment that others can ssh into. The users only have access to the folders mapped and the processes running inside this container.

**Enable Armbian firmware upgrades** manages whether the Armbian firmware (kernel + u-boot + firmware) packages are held or unheld in the package manager. By removing or setting the hold, it controls if firmware updates are applied automatically through regular `apt update` and `apt upgrade` processes. This allows users to either freeze the firmware version for stability or enable updates for improved hardware support.
