Duplicati is a versatile and secure backup tool designed for everyone, including:

- Users new to backup systems who need a simple and reliable solution.
- Experienced users who want full control over encrypted backups and storage destinations.
- System administrators who require automated, encrypted backups across multiple platforms.

Duplicati offers powerful features such as strong AES-256 encryption, backup scheduling, and flexible storage support (local folders, NAS, cloud providers like Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, and more).  
Through its web-based interface, users can easily configure, monitor, and restore backups from any browser.

Thanks to Duplicati’s smart design — working through standard protocols and containerized deployment — it fits seamlessly into any environment, from personal setups to enterprise infrastructures.
