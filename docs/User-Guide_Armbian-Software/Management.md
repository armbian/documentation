Introducing Cockpit
Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers, intended for everyone, especially those who are:

- new to Linux
(including Windows admins)
- familiar with Linux
and want an easy, graphical way to administer servers
- expert admins
who mainly use other tools but want an overview on individual systems

Thanks to Cockpit intentionally using system APIs and commands, a whole team of admins can manage a system in the way they prefer, including the command line and utilities right alongside Cockpit.
