SWAG - Secure Web Application Gateway sets up an Nginx webserver and reverse proxy with php support and a built-in certbot client that automates free SSL server certificate generation and renewal processes (Let's Encrypt). It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention.

After entering required information, your server will have auto updating SSL secured website! To this website you can attach several services, for example: https://my.server.com/netdata will run [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) instance.

=== "Requirements"

    - this computer port 80 and 443 must be open to the internet
    - your domain name (myserver.mydomain.com) DNS server should point to your router WAN address
    - make sure to set additional .htpasswd username and password as you don't want to expose your services without password

=== "Directories"

    - Config directory: `/armbian/swag/config/`
    - Website root folder: `/armbian/swag/config/www/`
    - Reverse proxy configuration samples: `/armbian/swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/`
