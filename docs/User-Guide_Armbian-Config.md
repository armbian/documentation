# Armbian configuration utility

### Note: armbian-config is undergoing major rewrite and therefore is not receiving much attention. So functions might not be available or even broken, especially on more recent boards.

Is a base utility for configuring your board, divided into four main sections:

- **S**ystem - system and security settings,
- **N**etwork - wired, wireless, Bluetooth, access point,
- **P**ersonal - timezone, language, hostname,
- **S**oftware - system and 3rd party software install.
