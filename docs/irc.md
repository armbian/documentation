# IRC Channel

Quick overview:
Armbian members can community in realtime using the internet relay chat (IRC)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
Well known clients for CLI are weechat and irssi and for GUI Hexchat.

### Channels

- The main channel is #armbian. As for now every user interaction happens there, from user to user help to upcoming release talks (link to docs).
-  #armbian-commits is a moderated channel. Whenever a new interaction with the build repository on Github happens it will be announced. Also newly added issues on Jira will be pasted.
- #armbian-rss is a live forum feed. Whenever a new post in the Armbian Forums is made it will be announced here.

We may or may not add more channels in future depending on the needs.
