# IRC Channel

### Overview

Armbian members can community in realtime using the internet relay chat (IRC)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
Well known clients for CLI are weechat and irssi and for GUI Hexchat.

### Channels

- The main channel is #armbian. As for now every user interaction happens there, from user to user help to upcoming release talks (link to docs).
-  #armbian-commits is a moderated channel. Whenever a new interaction with the build repository on Github happens it will be announced. Also newly added issues on Jira will be pasted.
- #armbian-rss is a live forum feed. Whenever a new post in the Armbian Forums is made it will be announced here.

We may or may not add more channels in future depending on the needs.


### FAQ
- *Why are there so many people in the channel and nobody is talking?*  
It is pretty common for community IRC channels for people to simply *idle* there. Many also using so called IRC bouncers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software) that keeps their connection to the channel alive.
- *I wrote 'Hi' but nobody answered. How do I get support there?*  
Probably there is nobody around at the time. Keep in mind that all users are spread around the globe and therefore living in many different time zones.
It is common habit to simply stated your question or issue and then wait patiently for an answer. Depending how complex this may take up to a few hours because most Armbian contributions can only cover a specific board family for example.
- *Is the chat history public as well?*  
Yes. The channel is redundantly logged. All logs are open to the public and can be read here: http://irc.armbian.com
- *Why do some people have odd hostnames like '@armbian/staff/lanefu' or '@unaffiliated/username'?*  
These *hostnames* are so called project affiliation cloaks. These are meant to show a users affiliation to a specific project and their role there. You can find more information about that here: (link to freenode info about cloaks)
