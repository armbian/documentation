# IRC Channel


### Overview

As [announced earlier](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/12803-armbian-irc-channel/) in the forums Armbian members can communicate in realtime using the [internet relay chat (or *IRC* in short)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).
Well known clients for CLI are [Weechat](https://weechat.org/) and [Irssi](https://irssi.org/) and for GUI [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/).


### Connect

If you have a desktop environment with properly installed IRC client simply put this URL into your internet browser: `irc://chat.freenode.net/armbian`
Or put the data in your client manually:
- Server: **chat.freenode.net**
- Ports: **6697** / non-SSL: 6667
- Channel: **#armbian**


### Channels

- The main project's channel is **#armbian**. As for now all user interaction happens there, regardless if chit-chat, issue tracking, peer-to-peer user support or even [upcoming release planning talks](https://docs.armbian.com/Process_Release-Model/#release-planning).
- **#armbian-commits** is a moderated channel. Whenever a new interaction with the build repository on Github happens it will be announced. Also newly added issues on Jira will be pasted.
- #armbian-rss is a live forum feed. Whenever a new post in the Armbian Forums is made it will be announced here.

You are free to join any of these channels.
We may or may not add more channels in future depending on the needs.

### Services

nickserv, chanserv
Armbianhelper, github, twitter
Commands needs to be consolidated before making a list public. Would be too messy ^^



### FAQ
- *Why are there so many people in the channel and nobody is talking?*  
It is pretty common for community IRC channels for people to simply *idle* there. Many also using so called IRC bouncers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software) that keeps their connection to the channel alive.
- *I wrote 'Hi' but nobody answered. How do I get support there?*  
Probably there is nobody around at the time. Keep in mind that all users are spread around the globe and therefore living in many different time zones.
It is common habit to simply stated your question or issue and then wait patiently for an answer. Depending how complex this may take up to a few hours because most Armbian contributions can only cover a specific board family for example.
- *Is the chat history public as well?*  
Yes. The channel is redundantly logged. All logs are open to the public and can be read here: http://irc.armbian.com
- *Why do some people have odd hostnames like '@armbian/staff/lanefu' or '@unaffiliated/username'?*  
These *hostnames* are so called project affiliation cloaks. These are meant to show a users affiliation to a specific project and their role there. You can find more information about that here: (link to freenode info about cloaks)
