# IRC Channel


## :clap: --------------- Overview

As announced in the [forums](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/12803-armbian-irc-channel/) everyone interested can communicate in realtime using the [internet relay chat (or *IRC*)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).
Well known clients for CLI are [Weechat](https://weechat.org/) or [Irssi](https://irssi.org/) and for GUI [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/). 
  <br/><br/>
  
## :electric_plug: --------------- Connect

If you have a desktop environment with properly installed IRC client simply put this URL into your internet browser: `irc://chat.freenode.net/armbian` (Unfortunately Markdown does not allow to create clickable irc:// links)  
Or put the data in your client manually:
- Server: `chat.freenode.net`
- Ports: `6697` / non-encrypted: 6667
- Channel: `#armbian`

Or simply use Freenode's webirc client: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=armbian
<br/><br/>

## :speech_balloon: --------------- Channels

- The main project's channel is **#armbian**. As for now all user interaction happens there, regardless if chit-chat, issue tracking, peer-to-peer user support or even [upcoming release planning talks](https://docs.armbian.com/Process_Release-Model/#release-planning).
- **#armbian-commits** is a moderated channel. Whenever a new interaction with the build repository on Github happens it will be announced. Also newly added issues on Jira will be pasted. User chat is not possible.
- **#armbian-rss** is a live forum feed. Whenever a new post in the Armbian Forums is made it will be announced here. User chat is not possible.
Of course you can also enable desktop notification in your favorite browser for the forums.

Everybody is free to join any of these channels.
We may or may not add more channels in future depending on the needs.

## :cop: --------------- Services

Besides the services offered by Freenode (like Nickserv or Chanserv) Armbian has set up some own services.  
- Armbianhelper
- Armbiangithub
- Armbiantwitter

Purpose and commands
Commands needs to be consolidated before making a list public. Would be too messy ^^

## :grey_question: --------------- FAQ
*Why are there so many people in the channel and nobody is talking?*
- ###### It is pretty common for community IRC channels for people to simply *idle* there. Many also using so called IRC bouncers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software) that keeps their connection to the channel alive.
*I wrote 'Hi' but nobody answered. How do I get support there?*  
- ###### Probably there is nobody around at the time. Keep in mind that all users are spread around the globe and therefore living in many different time zones.
It is a common habit to simply state your question or issue and then wait patiently for an answer. Depending how complex this may take up to a few hours because most Armbian contributions can only cover a specific board family for example.
*Is the chat history public as well?*  
- ###### Yes. The channel is redundantly logged. All logs are open to the public and can be read here: http://irc.armbian.com
*Why do some people have odd hostnames like '@armbian/staff/lanefu' or '@unaffiliated/username'?*  
- ###### These *hostnames* are so called project affiliation cloaks. These are meant to show a users affiliation to a specific project and their role there. You can find more information about that here: [https://freenode.net/kb/answer/cloaks](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/cloaks)
*Can I have that too?*  
- ###### Yes. An Armbian affiliation cloak can be requested from Werner either via forums or IRC. They usually will be granted if you are a well known member in forums, a contributor via Github or donated to the project. Make sure you identified yourself to Nickserv beforehand.
If you cannot find yourself in the list above you are free to request an unaffiliated cloak from Freenode staff. Check the link above for information.
*How can I protect my nickname so nobody can spoof me?*  
- ###### Register your nick with Freenode's Nickserv service. Check [https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration)
