## How to install Docker?

Minimal:

```bash
armbian-config --CON01
```

Full featured:

```bash
armbian-config --CON02
```

Test if Docker works correctly:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you get that kind of output, then Docker install went fine:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```
