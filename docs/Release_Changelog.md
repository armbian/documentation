Changes overview:

General:

- Ubuntu Xenial was replaced with Bionic unless kernel was too old for the change,
- Debian Jessie becomes EOL and its building is not maintained anymore while you will still receive kernel updates,
- Emergency swap file creation is disabled by default since we use compressed memory (ZRAM) as an alternative,
- `vm.swappiness` has been changed from 0 to 100 (if you run databases on your board you might want to revert this change in `/etc/sysctl.conf`),
- RAM logging also uses ZRAM now and rotates logs automagically,
- all images were rebuilt, except boards for which support ended,
- significantly lighter - browser only - desktop images (< 1.5G),
- fixed hanging on headers installation,
- install boot script (BSP package) if not present. This fixes upgrade or kernel switching problems,
- Proper bind mount directory when installing to SATA/USB and booting from SD,
- update for wireless drivers 8812/11/14AU, 8188EU and AUFS,
- Bugfix when a temperature is not present or readings are invalid,
- Also showing bridge IP addresses in MOTD,
- storing package list compressed - saves 50-70Mb,
- enlarging automated apt-get update and purge intervals,
- smaller overhead for CLI images,
- improved alternative kernel switching,
- stop setting Google's DNS server as default for privacy reasons.
