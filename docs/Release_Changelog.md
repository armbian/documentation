* fixed Chromium on Debian builds with a workaround. We are overwriting package with last known working one. It will show some error on startup which is safe to ignore. This workaround will fade out with Chromium upstream update.

## v5.60 (2018-09-19)

Changes overview:

General:

* Ubuntu Xenial was replaced with Bionic unless kernel was too old for the change,
* Debian Jessie becomes EOL and its building is not maintained anymore while you will still receive kernel updates,
* Emergency swap file creation is disabled by default since we use compressed memory (ZRAM) as an alternative,
* `vm.swappiness` has been changed from 0 to 100 (if you run databases on your board you might want to revert this change in `/etc/sysctl.conf`),
* RAM logging also uses ZRAM now and rotates logs automagically,
* all images were rebuilt, except boards for which support ended,
* significantly lighter - browser only - desktop images (< 1.5G),
* fixed hanging on headers installation,
* install boot script (BSP package) if not present. This fixes upgrade or kernel switching problems,
* Proper bind mount directory when installing to SATA/USB and booting from SD,
* update for wireless drivers 8812/11/14AU, 8188EU and AUFS,
* Bugfix when a temperature is not present or readings are invalid,
* Also showing bridge IP addresses in MOTD,
* storing package list compressed - saves 50-70Mb,
* enlarging automated apt-get update and purge intervals,
* smaller overhead for CLI images,
* improved alternative kernel switching,
* stop setting Google's DNS server as default for privacy reasons.
