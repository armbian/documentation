# Collaborate on the project

## How?

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the project.
1. Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the repository. 
1. Perform a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in Github's web interface.

If it is a new feature request, do not start the coding first. Remember to [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to discuss the new feature. If you want to [add code to someone else pull request](https://tighten.co/blog/adding-commits-to-a-pull-request/). Also check collection of [git tips](https://github.com/git-tips/tips) which will make your life easier.
