# Testing the speed of wireless adapters

All wireless adapters were tested under consistent conditions - each positioned in close proximity (1-2m) and connected to the same wireless access point (AP). The adapters utilized various interface types, including USB, SDIO, and PCI, to evaluate performance across different hardware configurations.

## Test Equipment

- **Access Point**: [Zyxel NWA130BE (Wi-Fi 7)](https://amzn.to/428dvnH)
- **Network Switches**: 
  - Netgear XS712T  
  - Netgear XS508M
- **Power Switches**: APC AP7920  
- **Client Devices**:
  - Multiple single-board computers equipped with onboard wireless modules or PCI Wi-Fi cards
  - USB wireless test server: [Geekom IT13](https://amzn.to/4crUVKP) with an [i-Tec 16-port USB 3.0 hub](https://amzn.to/42B4B29)

## Software and Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure Database**: [NetBox](https://netbox.dev) for resource modeling and inventory
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration and test execution
- **Networking**: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for secure device connectivity across the test environment
- **Test Platform**: KVM virtual machine running the latest x86 Armbian image for USB wireless testing

## Methodology

**Overview of the WiFi performance test process:**

1. ⚡ **Power On Devices**  
   └─ Embedded WiFi-capable devices and USB wireless adapters are powered on.

2. 🌐 **Configure Wireless Connection**  
   └─ Devices are configured to connect to a predefined access point (SSID).

3. 📶 **Connect to WiFi Network**  
   └─ Network connectivity is validated to ensure the device is routable.

4. 📊 **Measure Performance (iperf3)**  
   ├─ Perform reverse (`-R`) and forward iperf3 tests  
   └─ Measure throughput and link quality.

5. 🔍 **Collect System & Network Info**  
   ├─ Extract link details (e.g. bitrate, signal strength)  
   └─ Record system version, kernel, architecture.

6. 🔁 **Restore Wired Network**  
   └─ Reapply original routes and configuration.

7. ☁️ **Upload Test Results**  
   └─ Summary, logs, and system info are uploaded as artifacts.

8. 📴 **Power Off Devices**  
   └─ All test devices are safely powered down after testing completes.
