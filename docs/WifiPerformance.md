# Testing the speed of wireless connections

All Wi-Fi adapters were tested under consistent conditions‚Äîeach positioned in close proximity and connected to the same wireless access point (AP). The adapters utilized various interface types, including USB, SDIO, and PCI, to evaluate performance across different hardware configurations.

## Test Equipment

- **Access Point**: [Zyxel NWA130BE (Wi-Fi 7)](https://amzn.to/428dvnH)
- **Network Switches**: 
  - Netgear XS712T  
  - Netgear XS508M
- **Power Switches**: APC AP7920  
- **Client Devices**:
  - Multiple single-board computers equipped with onboard wireless modules or PCI Wi-Fi cards
  - USB wireless test server: [Geekom IT13](https://amzn.to/4crUVKP) with an [i-Tec 16-port USB 3.0 hub](https://amzn.to/42B4B29)

## Software and Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure Database**: [NetBox](https://netbox.dev) for resource modeling and inventory
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration and test execution
- **Networking**: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for secure device connectivity across the test environment
- **Test Platform**: KVM virtual machine running the latest x86 Armbian image for USB wireless testing

## Methodology

**Overview of the WiFi performance test process:**

1. ‚ö° **Power On Devices**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Embedded WiFi-capable devices and USB wireless adapters are powered on.

2. üåê **Configure Wireless Connection**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Devices are configured to connect to a predefined access point (SSID).

3. üì∂ **Connect to WiFi Network**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Network connectivity is validated to ensure the device is routable.

4. üìä **Measure Performance (iperf3)**  
   ‚îú‚îÄ Perform reverse (`-R`) and forward iperf3 tests  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Measure throughput and link quality.

5. üîç **Collect System & Network Info**  
   ‚îú‚îÄ Extract link details (e.g. bitrate, signal strength)  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Record system version, kernel, architecture.

6. üîÅ **Restore Wired Network**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Reapply original routes and configuration.

7. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Upload Test Results**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ Summary, logs, and system info are uploaded as artifacts.

8. üì¥ **Power Off Devices**  
   ‚îî‚îÄ All test devices are safely powered down after testing completes.
