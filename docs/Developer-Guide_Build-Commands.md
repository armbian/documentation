# Build commands

### kernel

Builds kernel and device tree (where applicable) and places it to the `output/debs`

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh kernel BOARD=nanopi-r5c BRANCH=edge
```

### kernel-config

Automatically call kernel's `make menuconfig` (add or remove modules or features)

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh kernel-config BOARD=nanopi-r5c BRANCH=edge
```

### dts-check

Validate dts files and improve board & patch development overall.

This option validates the dts/dtb file for the selected board against the device tree bindings and outputs the validation logs to the user. It can be used when adding a new board, developing or improving a dts file.

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh dts-check BOARD=nanopi-r5c BRANCH=edge 
```
### inventory-boards

Outputs a one-board-per-line CSV inventory of boards.

Sets `TARGETS_FILE` to something that doesn't exist, so the `default-targets.yaml` is used (so same list for everyone, save for userpatched-boards)

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh inventory-boards
```
Outputs /info/boards-inventory.csv

### kernel-dtb

Builds only DTB and outputs full preprocessed dts source

Outputs preprocessed DTS source for the board in question to `output/`
also outputs the same preprocessed DTS source, ran through `dtc` with input and output DTS formats for "normalized" comparisons

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh kernel-dtb BOARD=xxxxx BRANCH=edge
```

### uboot-patch

Create patch files for u-boot.

The output patch files are written to
**output/patch/u-boot-${LINUXFAMILY}-${[BRANCH](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Switches/#user-space)}.patch**.
To use them in subsequent builds they
must be copied to the appropriate directories in the patch/u-boot directory.
See: [user-provided patches](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_User-Configurations/#user-provided-patches)

Any uncommited changes in the work tree and index are commited
to establish a clean work tree.
It would be best if there are no uncommitted changes when running
`uboot-patch`.

If there is an existing patch file at the output path specified above, it
may be applied before continuning work.

When the prompt `Press <ENTER\> after you are done editing in ${pwd}` appears,
in a separate window, navigate to the specified directory
and make any required changes.
When changes are complete,
return to the window running the `uboot-patch` command
and press `<ENTER>`. 

A patch to recreate the changes introduced to the u-boot tree is presented
and the prompt "Are you happy with this patch?".
You can response
`yes` to accept the patch as-is and generate the output patch file,
`stop` to abort the command without producing the outpu patch file,
or anything else to loop back, to make futher changes.

Instead of creating them while running `uboot-patch`,
new device tree files should be created in the relevant `dt` directory under
`patch/u-boot`
and new _defconfig files should be created in the relevant `configs` directory
under `patch/u-boot`.
While the `uboot-patch` command will add these new files to the patch
if they are created while running `uboot-patch`,
this is not the preferred way of adding these files.

### rewrite-uboot-patches

Prepares git, applies patches to git, and rewrites them back from git
same as kernel, it does git archeology for mbox-less patches, etc.

Note: MAINTAINER and MAINTAINEREMAIL should be set.

- uboot-patches-to-git alias is also added, but my guess is that the rewrite is more useful.
- refactor a common config function for both kernel and uboot.

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh rewrite-uboot-patches BOARD=xxxx BRANCH=edge 
```

### rewrite-kernel-patches

Prepares git, applies patches to git, and rewrites them back from git
same as kernel, it does git archeology for mbox-less patches, etc.

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh rewrite-kernel-patches BOARD=xxxx BRANCH=edge 
```

### targets

Generates output/info/git_sources.json file containing URL, branch, and commit hash combo.

The easiest way to generate file for all devices is to run `./compile.sh targets`. Then, at the time of release, we will copy the output/info/git_sources.json file to config/sources/git_sources.json. Once the file is copied, the hash information from the file will be used to fetch resources for git repositories where branches are specified instead of tags or commits.

Usage:
```bash
./compile.sh targets
```
